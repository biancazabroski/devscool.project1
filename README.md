# Basic social news program

## Objective 

The goal of this project is to build a basic social news program. Its users will be able to show a list of links and add new ones.

## Challenge :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: 

- A link is defined by its title, its URL and its author (submitter).

- If a new link URL does not start with "http://" or "https://", "http://" is automatically added to its beginning.

- At launch, the program displays a start menu with the possible actions in an alert window and asks the user for his choice. Possible actions are:

:one: Show the list of links.
:two: Add a new link.
:three: Remove an existing link.
:four: Quit the program.

- Showing the list of links displays the index (rank) and the properties of each link in an alert window, or a message in the absence of any link.

- When adding a link, the program asks the user for the new link properties (title, URL and author). The link is then created. Subsequently, it must appear in the shown links.

- When removing a link, the user is asked for the link index until it is correct. The associated link is then removed. Subsequently, it must disappear from the shown links. Removing a link is not possible if there are no existing links.

- After an action is performed, the start menu is shown again. This goes on until the user chooses to quit the program.
